# AML-Course-Repo

This is the Github repo for Advanced Machine Learning course (AML) offered by Columbia University. I think it is essential to sort the materials in this manner provided for future generations. 

# Notes

The folder presents latex notes written for the materials of this course. The materials for this course is substantial for the graduate studies for students as well as for industry practitioners. It came to the attention that it is worth my time to collect and organize this material for the audience. 

I apologize up front if some paragraphs have typos or mistakes. Please contact me through yy2502@columbia.edu. 

# Homework

The folder presents the five homeworks submitted for this course. I also presented correct solutions for the audience to refer to. 

# Project

We present a folder for our final project. 

The project investigates the CIFAR10 dataset. We attempt using CNN and improved CNN with wide range of tuning parameters. We present test results of xxx\% for 10-class image classification.

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class. 

The project is to implement selected deep learning classifier to perform well on this dataset.
